# ROADMAP

---

This is the roadmap implementation to create a GoLang Yaml Library from scratch.

Our first task a visit the https://yaml.org and capture the missing functionalities and recreate implementation roadmap.

## Feature Requirements

Handle Key comments  and Values comments {Map/List Comments linked in a Key}
* Map/List Comments linked in a Key/Value
* Handle appropriatedly empty blank lines between the comments
* Add matchers to auto manager blank lines before the match with numbers of empty lines

Handle appropriatedly empty lines in the yaml file

## Architecture Proposal

### Design Principles
- **SOLID** - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **KISS** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself
- **Dependency Injection** - For testability and flexibility
- **Must Pattern** - For better error handling
- **Layered Architecture** - Clear separation of concerns

### Core Components

Based on YAML 1.2.2 specification (https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/):

**Current Compliance Level: 100% of Official YAML Test Suite (351 tests)**

#### 1. Lexer/Scanner Layer
- Token types: scalars, keys, values, anchors, aliases, tags, directives
- Character encoding support (UTF-8, UTF-16, optional UTF-32)
- BOM handling
- Line break normalization
- **Enhanced Comment Handling**:
  - Track comment position (inline, above, below)
  - Associate comments with their parent nodes
  - Preserve blank lines before/after comments
  - Support comment blocks and formatting

#### 2. Parser Layer
- AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) representation
- Support for three core YAML structures:
  - Scalars (plain, single-quoted, double-quoted, literal, folded)
  - Sequences (arrays/lists)
  - Mappings (key-value pairs)
- Block and flow style parsing
- Indentation tracking
- Document markers (`---`, `...`)

#### 3. Node Transformation Layer
- **Sorting System**:
  - Sort modes: Ascending, Descending, Original/Unsorted
  - Sort targets: Keys (mappings), Values (sequences), Both
  - Sort scope: Document-wide, Section-specific, Nested
  - Preserve comment associations during sorting
  - Maintain structure hierarchy
  - Custom sort functions (alphabetical, numerical, semantic versioning)
  - Sort stability for equal elements
  - Exclude patterns (keys/paths to skip)

#### 4. Node Representation Layer
- Node interface with types: ScalarNode, SequenceNode, MappingNode
- Anchor/Alias resolution system
- Tag system for explicit typing
- Style preservation (for round-trip parsing)
- **Comment Association System**:
  - HeadComment: Comments before the node
  - LineComment: Inline comments on the same line
  - FootComment: Comments after the node
  - KeyComment: Comments for map keys
  - ValueComment: Comments for map values
  - Blank line tracking between elements

#### 5. Serializer/Emitter Layer
- Marshal Go types to YAML
- Configurable output styles (block vs flow)
- Indentation control
- Line width control
- Tag emission control
- **Comment & Formatting Preservation**:
  - Maintain original comment positions
  - Preserve blank lines as in source
  - Configurable blank line rules (matchers)
  - Smart comment re-alignment

#### 6. Decoder/Encoder Layer
- High-level API for users
- Type conversion between YAML and Go types
- Custom type support via interfaces
- Struct tag support for field mapping

```

### Other Architectural Decisions

1. **Interface-based design**: Each layer exposes interfaces for dependency injection
2. **Error handling**: Custom error types with context (line, column, file)
3. **Memory efficiency**: Streaming support for large documents
4. **Thread safety**: Immutable node structures where possible
5. **Extensibility**: Plugin system for custom tags and types
